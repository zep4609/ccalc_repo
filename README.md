# CCalc - A GTK+3.0 based graphing calculator in C.

This project is an application to assist research in the field of
hyperoperational calculus.

### Project Goals
- compute derivatives of elementary, trigonometric, and some special functions
- graph hyperoperational derivatives and integrals
- provide a clean and interactive user interface
